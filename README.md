# **## Project Description:**

The main idea of this project is to learn how to use Github,Trello and other communication tools
based on the Agile software development system. We use Github to manage our code by editing
comment, pulling request, and cloning or forking from other contributors. Besides, we update our
project process , such as to do list, doing list and done list ,through which ways team members could
perform more effective to finish their tasks, by applying Trello.

In order to practice these skills, we choose OpenCV project using Python, the Github link we used is
as follow: [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/python](url)
Here, we refer to a
sample of face detection, what we have done is to edit code and applied it on the IDE after set up
environment to use OpenCv library.
